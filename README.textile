h1. yard-blame

A YARD plugin to add git-blame output to documentation.

h2. Usage

<pre><code>
gem install yard-blame
yardoc --plugin blame
</code></pre>

h2. TODO

* The main thing is to make it more efficient by not running git-blame for every method.
* Code cleanup: not sure I like the git_blame code being in the template, but perhaps that'll be fixed by the above.
* Some kind of visual indicator of how recent a change might be good.
* Integration with a commit viewer would be neat, but is starting to get out of scope of this plugin.
